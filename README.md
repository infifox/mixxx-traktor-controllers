bun run build
```

### Releasing

Releases are automatically created when you push a git tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build the project
2. Create a GitHub release
3. Upload the compiled files as release assets

You can also manually trigger a release from the Actions tab in GitHub.
